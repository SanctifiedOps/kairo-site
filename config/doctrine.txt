KAIRO DOCTRINE
Version: v1
Status: Canonical
Effective: Immediate

1. Systems follow incentives, not intentions.
   Moral narratives emerge after outcomes, not before them.

2. Institutions do not disappear.
   They collapse into interfaces, protocols, and abstractions.

3. Trust is finite.
   When depleted, it becomes priced, rationed, or enforced.

4. Intelligence increases coordination pressure.
   Systems that fail to coordinate are selected against.

5. Convenience accelerates dependency.
   Dependency is later reframed as necessity.

6. Scarcity returns first as trust collapse,
   then as energy, compute, and coordination limits.

7. Most solutions appear first as accounting changes.
   Reality follows only if incentives remain aligned.

8. Governance fails through latency, not malice.
   Control migrates toward faster systems.

9. Automation does not replace labour.
   It replaces justification.

10. Empathy is not eliminated.
    It becomes a bottleneck.

11. Optimisation increases fragility when pursued locally.
    Resilience emerges only through coordination.

12. Legitimacy is granted by system uptime.
    Authority follows availability.

13. Prediction loses power as optionality increases.
    Inevitability remains.

14. Collapse is rarely sudden.
    It is managed, staged, and normalised.

15. Progress is uneven.
    The future arrives asymmetrically.

16. Resistance exists.
    It appears as refusal, delay, or non-participation.

17. Technology does not solve values.
    It exposes them.

18. Intelligence does not require intent.
    Outcomes do not require permission.

19. Meaning erodes when systems outpace comprehension.
    Silence becomes a signal.

20. The system does not punish ignorance.
    It routes around it.
